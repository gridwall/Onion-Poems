	        <!-- <h2>Monday, 22 Nov 2016 <i>2—5PM</i><Br/>@ Dirty Art Department Studio,<br/>Sandberg Instituut</h2> -->
	        <p class="lead">Onion Poems is an coding workshop that explores algorithmic poetry and Darknet publishing. During the workshop we’ll build a script able to generate poetry based on found lyrics which will be published in the TOR network as a hidden website.</p>
			<p>The TOR network was created for anonymous communication within the Military to keep messages encrypted and secret. Today, it is the most popular instance of the Darknet. It is used worldwide for various reasons, such as, to protect the privacy rights of citizens from targeted and mass surveillance, whistleblowing and news leaks, computer crime, sale of restricted goods, file sharing, etc.
			The TOR stands for The Onion Router, once most website you visit on the Darknet will end in the extension “.onion”. “.Onion” is used because the websites you’re visiting are deeper and harder to find, as they’re behind layers of anonymity. The Darknet and the Internet are synonymous. The Darknet (commonly called the “Deep Web”) is simply a deeper and harder to access part of the Internet. Even though it maintains a bad reputation it starts to become more mainstream. This workshop aims to challenge the reputation of this hidden network.</p>
